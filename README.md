## Learning Objectives - The student should be able to..

* Complete this lab, solidifying what it is they know about this unit and ones prior.

## What the student can do at this point 

* Has a general overview of Xcode and is able to create a new project.
* Knows where to locate the testing file within Xcode.
* Knows how to navigate to Interface Builder.
* Knows what a storyboard file is.
* Has a brief overview of what the Object Library is.
* Can drag a View Controller onto the canvas.
* Can locate and drag items from the Object Library.
* Can locate the Attributes Inspector and change the Background color of Views
* They know how to connect the ViewController.swift file and understand its view life cycle.

## Outline / Notes

* This could be something similar to an Objective-C [lab](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/OOP-Cards-Simple-Views) which we can copy.
* This is the final one of this unit. Could make it more difficult. I was thinking about having them make Blackjack which is something we do in the immersive course, but they don't know about classes yet and how to make custom objects so I don't see that as a viable option.
